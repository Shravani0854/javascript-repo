"use strict";//treat all JS code as newer version


//alert(3+3) //can't write will get error because we are using nodejs,not browser
console.log(3+3); console.log("shra") //can write but not ideal...reduces code readability
console.log(3
    +3)  //code readability should be high

console.log("shra")

// primitive data types
let name="shra" //string
let age=18 //numbers
let isLoggedIn = false // boolean

//number => 2 to the power 53
//bigint
//string => can write in single/double quote,double is preferred
//boolean => true/false
//null=>data type in js and standalone value-representation of empty value(not undefined it is empty)
//undefined //when value is not given or assigned
//symbol =>used to identify component is js(to identify uniqueness of each component)

//object

console.log(typeof "Shev"); //op is string
console.log(typeof age); //don't include quotes...op is number
console.log(typeof null);//op is object
